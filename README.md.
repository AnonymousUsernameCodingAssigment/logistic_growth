Results 
* Estimates for N0, r and K 
* Which .csv file did I use? 
* Use your estimates of N0 and r to calculate the population size at t = 4980 min, assuming that the population grows exponentially. How does it compare to the population size predicted under logistic growth?

* Add an R script to your repository that makes a graph comparing the exponential and logistic growth curves (using the same parameter estimates you found). Upload this graph to your repo and include it in the README.md file so it can be viewed in the repo homepage.
